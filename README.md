## <img src="assets/logo.png" height="30"> GeoPixel Overview  
GeoPixel is the first large multimodal model explicitly designed for high-resolution remote sensing (RS) image comprehension and pixel-level grounding. The model processes natural language user queries with RS imagery to generate detailed outputs, incorporating interleaved masks that adapt dynamically to the spatial resolution and complexity of the input.

## 🏆 Highlights  
- We present GeoPixel, a pixel grounding Large Multimodal Model optimized for high-resolution remote sensing image comprehension. It features adaptive image partitioning into local and global regions, enabling efficient processing of resolutions up to 4K in any aspect ratio.
- A rich annotated dataset GeoPixelD, is created that supports Remote Sensing Grounded Conversation Generation RS-GCG. This dataset combines scene-level context and object-level details through a scalable annotation pipeline that uses advanced visual prompting designed for RS imagery.
- A detailed evaluation benchmark is provided, containing 5,427 validated referring expression-mask pairs and 61,384 annotated objects. The dataset, with detailed descriptions averaging 647 characters, establishes a standard for testing the fine-grained understanding and generation capabilities of remote sensing models.

## 🛠️ Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/architecture.png" alt="GeoPixel Architecture">
</p>

GeoPixel is fundamentally composed of five key blocks: (1) Adaptive Image Divider (2) Vision Encoder (3) Large Language Model (4) Grounding Vision Encoder (5) Pixel Decoder. These modules are seamlessly integrated to facilitate high-resolution visual perception, fine-grained semantic interpretation, and precise pixel-level grounding of Remote Sensing (RS) imagery.

## 🏷️ Annotation Pipeline

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/annotation_pipeline.png" alt="Annotation Pipeline">
</p>

We propose a semi-automatic annotation pipeline for creating a remote sensing grounded conversation generation (RS-GCG) dataset. It employs a multi-level hierarchical strategy that includes holistic scene descriptions, individual instance annotations, and group-level semantic representations, enabling a comprehensive understanding of spatial relationships and object-level details. Advanced techniques, such as Set-of-Mark (SOM) prompting combined with spatial and categorical priors, are utilized to enhance the accuracy and granularity of object-specific annotations.

Performance Comparison of various models on the Remote Sensing Grounded Conversation Generation (RS-GCG) task. LISA† and PixelLM† refer to pretrained models finetuned on GeoPixelD training data. GLaMM represents zero-shot performance, while GLaMM-FT denotes the pretrained model finetuned on GeoPixelD. GeoPixel demonstrates superior performance across all metrics.

</p>

Performance Comparison of GeoPixel in Referring Expression Segmentation on RRSIS-D dataset: The segmentation accuracy based on referring expressions is expressed through the Precision at IoU threshold of 0.5 (P@0.5), Overall Intersection-over-Union (oIoU) and Mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU).
